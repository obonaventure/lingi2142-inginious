    A token bucket allows to precisely define the traffic contract of a packet flow. It is defined with two parameters :
     - a rate `R` expressed in bits/sec
     - a burst size `B` expressed in bits

    When used in shaping mode, the token bucket delays the packets that are considered invalid.

            Consider a token bucket attached to a 1 Mbps link and configured ith R=100 Kbps and B=1000 bits. The token bucket receives the following packets
