            Consider a token bucket that uses the following parameters :
             - Rate = 500 kbps
             - burst = 1000 bits

            The token bucket is connected to a 1 Mbps link and it receives a series of packets. Each packet has a size of 1000 bits and the delay between two successive packets on the input link is 1 msec. A dot (``.``) in the traffic pattern corresponds to a 1 msec period without any packet. Each letter identifies a packet.

            If the token bucket receives the traffic pattern below, list the packets that will be accepted by the token bucket (assume that the rightmost packet is the first received packet):

            ``vurqponmlkjihgfedcba``

            If a packet has not been accepted then replace its character with a ``.`` in your answer. For example, if only every fifth character is accepted, then your answer should be ``..p....k....f....a``

             - burst = 2000 bits
