    The deficit round-robin scheduler servers packets in the different queues according to a fixed cyclic schedule. For this exercise, we assume that the schedule is Q1, Q2, Q1, Q2, ...

    The scheduler is attached to a 1 Mbps link. All incoming flows also arrive on 1 Mbps links.

    The packets that arrive in queue `Q1` are represented using upper case letters. The packets that arrived in `Q2` are represented using lower case letters. A dot (``.``) in the incoming traffic pattern corresponds to a period of one millisecond without any incoming packet. For this exercise, we assume that *Q1* sends 2000 bits long packets while the other queues send 1000 bits long packets.

            Queue `Q1` receives the following packets (``A`` is the first received packet) :
