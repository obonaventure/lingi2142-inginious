    Round-robin and deficit round-robin are examples of schedulers that allow to evenly distribute bandwidth among different incoming flows.

    Consider a (d)RR scheduler with three queues: `Q1`, `Q2` and `Q3`. This scheduler is attached to a 1 Mbps output link and the flows that are classifed in the three queues also arrive at a rate of 1 Mbps.

    q1:
        header: |4-
             The scheduler receives the following packet flows

            - `Q1` receives traffic at a rate of 400 Kbps
            - `Q2` receives traffic at a rate of 600 Kbps
            - `Q3` receives traffic at a rate of 800 Kbps
