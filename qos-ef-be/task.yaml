    q1:
        choices:
        -   feedback: Placing the EF flow in a shaper will cause additional delays.

    q3:
        choices:
        -   text: This is a valid design
            feedback: Placing the BE flows in the policer would imply that best effort
                packets would be dropped when there is no EF traffic.

            text: This is a valid design
            feedback: Note that this is not an optimal design from a delay viewpoint
                since EF packets might be delayed by best effort packets.
        -   feedback: If you use dWRR, there is no need to police the EF traffic.
                Note that this is not an optimal design from a delay viewpoint since
                EF packets might be delayed by best effort packets.

        choices:
        -   text: This is a valid design
            valid: true
            feedback: But there is a risk of starvation of the best effort traffic
                since there is no limit to the EF traffic.

        choices:
        -   valid: true
            feedback: In this case, the policer restricts the amount of EF traffic
                that enters the queues and the large weight ensures that EF will receive
                a low delay through the queue.

            feedback: 'This design provides a lower delay to EF than to BE since EF
                has a weight that is twice as large. '

            feedback: This design provides 10% of the output bandwidth to EF but not
                a low delay in contrast with the previous one
