    A token bucket allows to precisely define the traffic contract of a packet flow. It is defined with two parameters :
     - a rate `R` expressed in bits/sec
     - a burst size `B` expressed in bits

            Consider a token bucket attached to a 1 Mbps link and configured ith R=100 Kbps and B=1000 bits. The token bucket receives the following packets

            Packet at time  Length(bits)
            --------------  -------------
            `a` at 0.000 s   1000

                token bucket will only accept packets at a rate of 100 kbps, i.e.
                one packet every 10 msec.
