    Packet classification is one of the key elements of a routers to implement traffic control techniques.

    As an example, let us consider an IPv6 packet such as the following one :

    .. raw:: html

       <script defer>
       bodyHeight = 0;
       function postSize() {
           if (document.body.scrollHeight != bodyHeight) {
               bodyHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
               window.parent.postMessage({height: bodyHeight}, "*");
           }
       };
       var target = document.querySelector('body');

       var observer = new MutationObserver(postSize);

       var config = { attributes: true, subtree: true }

       observer.observe(target, config);
       $(document).ready(function(){
           document.querySelector('#content').style.minHeight = '';
           setTimeout(postSize, 0);
       });
       </script>
