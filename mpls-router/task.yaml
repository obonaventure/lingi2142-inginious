    Consider the *R7* MPLS router shown in the figure below.

    .. image:: https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/lingi2142-QCM/mpls-router/mpls-router.png

    This router uses per-node label space and has the following LFIB

    ====== =============  =====================
    Label  Outgoing intf  Operation
    ------ -------------  ---------------------
    L3     North-E        SWAP( L0)
    L4     East           POP
    L6     Local          POP
    L5     South-E        PUSH (L1)
    L9     South-East     SWAP (L8); PUSH (L4)
    ====== =============  =====================

    For this exercice, the MPLS stack of a packet is represented as as sequence of labels separated by a colon. For example, ``LX:LY:LZ`` is an MPLS stack containing three labels. ``LZ`` is the top label, ``LY`` the second one and ``LX`` the bottom one.
