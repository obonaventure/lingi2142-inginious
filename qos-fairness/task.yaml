    An enterprise network is attached to the Internet using a 100 Mbps line. The enterprise networks contains several servers using different operating systems. Some use TCP Vegas while others use TCP CUBIC and TCP BBR. Each server is managed by a different department and it is impossible to change these congestion control schemes.

            During a management meeting, on department head complained about the low performance of his fileserver. He did an experiment with a colleague who works from home. This colleague tried to download a large file from the server of department ``A`` and another file of similar size from department ``B``. The ``A`` server provides a throughput of more than 65 Mbps while server ``B`` could only reach 30 Mbps.

            ``B``'s department head is unhappy with this result and claims that the network was tuned to better serve department ``A`` than department ``B``. Describe the techniques that you would use to solve problem in one paragraph.
