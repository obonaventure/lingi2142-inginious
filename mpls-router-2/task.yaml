    Consider the *R7* MPLS router shown in the figure below.

    .. image:: https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/lingi2142-QCM/mpls-router-2/mpls-router.png

    This router uses per interface label space and has the following LFIB

    For this exercice, the MPLS stack of a packet is represented as as sequence of labels separated by a colon. For example, ``LX:LY:LZ`` is an MPLS stack containing three labels. ``LZ`` is the top label, ``LY`` the second one and ``LX`` the bottom one.
