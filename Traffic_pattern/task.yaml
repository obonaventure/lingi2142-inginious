    As in the previous exercise, we consider that packets enter our router at a rate of 10 Mbps and that they must be forwarded over a 1 Mbps link. Our router has a buffer which can hold up to `p` packets. On this router, a packet remains inside the buffer until the transmission of the last bit of the packet on the downstream link.

    For simplicity, we consider that all packets have a length of 10000 bits.

    We consider different traffic patterns that arrive on our router. These patterns will be represented as a sequence of ``P`` and ``.``. Each character corresponds to a delay of one millisecond. A ``P`` indicates the transmission of a 10000 bits long packet while ``.`` indicates no transmission. Each pattern repeats itself forever.

            Our router has a buffer which can hold up to three packets. This buffer is empty when it receives the following traffic pattern :

             ``..PP..PP..PP..PP..PP..PP``

            If the first packet is packet number 0, what is the number of the first packet that will be dropped by our router (-1 if packets are never dropped).
