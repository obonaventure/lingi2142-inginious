    Weighted round-robin and weighted deficit round-robin are examples of schedulers that allow to envenly distribute bandwidth among different incoming flows.

    Consider a (d)WRR scheduler with three queues: `Q1`, `Q2` and `Q3`. This scheduler is attached to a 1 Mbps output link and the flows that are classifed in the three queues also arrive at a rate of 1 Mbps.

        header: |-
            The scheduler is configured as follows :

             - `Q1` has a weight of 25
             - `Q2` has a weight of 50
             - `Q3` has a weight of 25

             The scheduler receives the following packet flows

            - `Q1` receives traffic at a rate of 400 Kbps
            - `Q2` receives traffic at a rate of 600 Kbps
            - `Q3` receives traffic at a rate of 800 Kbps

            Please provide your three answers using the `Add Answer` button. Each answer must be written as :math:`Qi=123` where :math:`Qi` is the identifier of the queue and 123 its bandwidth in kbps.
