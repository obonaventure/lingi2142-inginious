    Consider a router that receives packets from three incoming flows. Each flow enters the router over a 1 Mbps interface and all packets have a fixed size of 1000 bits. These flows are placed in three queues :

      - a high priority queue
      - a medium priority queue
      - a low priority queue

    The packets that correspond to the flow that is mapped in the high priority queue are represented using capital letters. The packets that correspond to the medium priority are represented using lower case letters and the numbers represent the packets from the low priority flow. A dot (``.``) indicates that no packet was sent during one millisecond.
