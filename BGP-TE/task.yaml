            feedback: With BGP community ``1239:70``, the import policy on Sprint's

            Several network operators have defined BGP Communities that can be used by their customers to control how the routes that they advertise will be ranked inside their own network.

            As an example, consider the BGP policy that is specified by Sprint and is described in https://www.sprint.net/index.php?p=policy_bgp

            Google's AS number is 15169. Assuming that Google is connected to Sprint, which of the following sentences are valid for a route advertised by a stub that has two links to Sprint.

                even if his political motivations are dubious.
            text: You quit your job because this cannot be implemented in BGP.
        -   feedback: This does not prevent ``AS6`` from receiving a route towards
                your prefix `p`. Your users will not be ablt to reach the prefix advertised
                by ``AS6``, but ``AS6`` will be able to reach you.
            text: You configure the import filters of your routers to discard all
                routes originated by ``AS6``.
        -   feedback: 'This does not prevent ``AS6`` from receiving a route towards
                your prefix `p`. '

                prefix `p` with AS-Path ``AS1:AS1:AS1:AS1``
            feedback: '``AS6`` would then likely prefer the path via ``AS2``.'

        -   valid: true
            feedback: This is strange, but it works because ``AS6`` will refuse to
                use a path that includes its own AS number in the AS-Path.

            You are responsible for ``AS1``. Assume that the Internet topology is the followin g:

            .. code:: console


               AS1 --- AS2 ---- AS4 ----- AS6
                +       +                 +
                +----- AS3 -- AS5 --- AS7 --+

            For political reasons, the CEO of your company wants to ensure that ``AS6`` never has a route towards prefix `p` advertised by ``AS1``. How do you implement this political decision with BGP knowing that your two providers do not support any BGP communities.
