    q1:
        choices:
        -   feedback: This attribute is usually inserted by the export filter.
            text: Multi Exit Discriminator
        -   valid: true
            text: local-pref
        -   text: Originator_Id
            feedback: This attribute is used by Route Reflectors, it does not influence
                the BGP decision process.
        -   feedback: This attribute is included in all BGP messages. It is not inserted
                by the import filter.
            text: AS Path
        -   text: The IGP cost
            feedback: This is not a BGP attribute
        multiple: true
        header: Which of the BGP attributes are typically inserted by *import* filters
            to influence the selection of the BGP routes inside an AS ?

        name: BGP Attributes inserted in the import filterWhich of the BGP attributes
            are typically inserted by import files to influence the selection of the
            BGP routes inside an AS ?
    q2:
        type: multiple-choice
        choices:
        -   text: The Multi Exit Discriminator
            valid: true
        -   text: local-pref
            feedback: This attribute is added by the import filter.
        -   text: The CLUSTER_LIST
            feedback: This attribute is only used by Route Reflectors. It does not
                influence the BGP decision process.
        -   text: The IGP cost
            feedback: This is not a BGP attribute
        name: BGP Attributes inserted in the export filter
        header: Which of the BGP attributes are typically inserted by *export* filters
            to influence the selection of the BGP routes inside the remote AS ?

    q3:
        choices:
        -   text: Setting the value of the local-pref attribute in the import filter
                of eBGP sessions
            valid: true
        -   text: Setting the value of the local-pref attribute in the export filter
                of eBGP sessions
            feedback: The local-pref attribute is only set in the import filter, not
                in the export filter
        -   valid: true
            text: Tune the IGP link weights
        -   feedback: This is rarely done, but it's also possible in case an operator
                wants to influence the BGP decision process after the AS-Path step.
            text: Setting the value of the Multi-Exit Discriminator attribute in the
                import filter of eBGP sessions
            valid: true
        -   text: Add several times your own AS in the AS-Path attribute in the export
                filter
            feedback: This is used to control the incoming traffic, not the outgoing
                one.

        header: Which of the following traffic engineering techniques can be used
