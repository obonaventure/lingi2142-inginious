    Networks are composed of links that operate at different bandwidth. When a router needs to forward the packets received from a high-speed link to a lower speed one. In this case, the packets are queued in the buffer before being transmitted on the low speed link.

    Let us consider two routers :
     - an upstream router
     - a downstream router

    The link between the upstream and the downstream router operates at 10 Mbps. The downstream router forwards the packets received from the upstream router over a 1 Mbps link.

            If the upstream router starts to send packets at 10 Mbps, how many seconds will last before the queue containing `q` bits becomes full ?

            `Provider your answer as an equation t=f(q) where t is the delay until the queue becomes full and q the capacity of the buffer`
