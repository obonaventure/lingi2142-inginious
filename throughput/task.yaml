    The throughput is an important metric for a network. The throughput of a physical interface is typically defined in bits/second. It corresponds to the maximum rate at which this link can transmit bits.

    We can also define the throughput of a regular flow of packets.

        header: Here are a series of descriptions of the packets sent by a source
            on a regular basis. Which of these descriptions correspond to a flow whose
            throughput is 10.000 bits per second ?
