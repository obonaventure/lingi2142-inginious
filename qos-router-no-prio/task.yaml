    Your are now responsible for an enterprise network. This network is composed of old routers that support four queues per output link and a dWRR scheduler. The enterprise needs to deploy telephones that use Voice over IP and the telephony vendor recommends that you prioritise the voice traffic in your network.

    Your enterprise is composed of two sites that are interconnected with a 40 Mbps link. There are 100 employees on each site and a telephone call is assumed to consume 100 kbps. How do you configure the different queues and the schedulers of the routers attached to the wide area link ?

    The classifier of the router is configured as follows :
    - queue1 receives the telephony packets
    - queue2 receives the other data packets
    - queue3 receives the BGP and OSPF packets
    - queue4 does not receive packets
