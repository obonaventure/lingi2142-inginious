            Consider the simple network shown in the ASCII figure below.

            In this network, ``R1``, ``RR`` and ``R2`` belong to ``AS1``. ``R1`` and ``R2`` are clients of the Route Reflector ``RR``. ``Rx`` belongs to ``AS2`` and ``Ry`` to ``AS3``. These two ASes are connected to ``AS4`` that advertises prefix `p`. This implies that :

            - ``Rx`` advertises prefix `p` with `AS-Path:`AS2:AS4` to ``R1``
            - ``Ry`` advertises prefix `p` with `AS-Path:`AS3:AS4` to ``R2``

            If link ``R1-RR`` has a cost of `1` and link ``RR-R2`` a cost of 2, what are the BGP routes known by these three routers ? (routes marked with * are the best ones, we assume that BGP Nexthop self is not used)
